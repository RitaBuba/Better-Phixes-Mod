 bpm_christdem_split.1.t: "Defending Your Humble Home"
 bpm_christdem_split.1.d: "The confluence of Catholicism with modern, sinful in their eyes, ideas of democracy, liberal secularization and state control of education has led to a widespread response by adherents of the Catholic denomination.\n\nPolitical movements to protect @ig_christian_democrats! #blue Catholic Interests#! from unfriendly state policies are beginning to emerge outside of electoral politics and in various groups, organizing themselves into various groups and organizations. Attempts to limit the influence of Catholics may be difficult."
 bpm_christdem_split.1.f: "It is also a mistake to believe that what exists today must survive until tomorrow and beyond, to want to maintain the present at all costs because we feel comfortable in it, to strive for immediate change in the present because we feel uncomfortable in it, and finally, to forget that the present is always, in reality, the emergence of a new state of affairs, and that this emergence is continuous.\n\n— Wojciech Korfanty, 1927"

 bpm_christdem_split.2.f: "There are not two souls in the Zentrum party, but seven different schools of thought, which shimmer in all colours of the political rainbow, from the farthest right to the radical left.

 bpm_christdem_flavour.1.t: "Primate of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Defends Democracy"
 bpm_christdem_flavour.1.desc: "Our Primate gave a high-profile and controversial speech in which he defended views that advocated standing up and staying on the ground of democracy as well as surreptitiously assuring that the Church is not hostile to the liberal constitution. The speech drew as much applause as voices of discontent for the Church's modernist policies, and the Primate himself was met with backlash."
 bpm_christdem_flavour.1.f: "I do not want to be constrained by the state to believe what it believes to be true, because the State is not the judge of truth. However the State is bound to protect me in the practice of the truth that I choose, that is to say, the exercise of the religion that I profess. This is what constitutes religious freedom in the modern state, which the free state is bound to respect and guarantee, not only for each citizen in particular, but for groups of citizens joined together to profess and propagate their belief, that is to say, for corporation, for associations, and for churches.\n\n— Charles de Montalembert, 1863"

 bpm_christdem_flavour.1.a: "The Church finally moves on and accepts the modern-day."
 bpm_christdem_flavour.1.b: "The Primate has gone too far into the modernist threat." 
 



 





 bpm_christdem_flavour.3.t: "All Alone Against All"
 bpm_christdem_flavour.3.desc: "The sense of political loneliness and forced self-reliance weighs on many Catholic activists, and is often exacerbated by the constant political battles for influence and members as well as the protection of their own from many unfriendly groups, from @ig_conservatives! Conservatives, through @ig_liberals! Liberals and @ig_socialists! Socialists, to the Catholic Church itself. While the constraints strain Catholics, they also give them the strength and drive to carry out ever more radical actions and defeat their opponents."
 bpm_christdem_flavour.3.f: "— I'm telling you that there is no way we can fight these diabolical liberals if we don't get ad hoc support from conservatives! I even got support from an offic—...\n\n— And I'm telling you that there's no way and with whom, because we're on our own!

 bpm_christdem_flavour.15.desc: "At a local meeting of one of the Catholic youth organizations, an incredible scandal occurred. Some of the youth, mostly workers, most simply refused to sing the national anthem, and argued with great resistance with the rest of the gathered over the incident.\n\nWord reached the local press that the section was significantly hostile to any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] symbolism, treating ‘traditional nationalism’ as ’socially reactionary’."
 bpm_christdem_flavour.15.f: "I remember years ago I had a section of working-class youth from my city under my control. The guys were very radical and diverse, but what religious zealots! All of them felt that the ideal of the flag in general was outdated, they always whined or argued when they were asked to pray for the state, and they refused to fly our flag every time, at every meeting whether with their own or others. They felt more connected to the people in general or as Europeans, and not as some nation."

 bpm_christdem_flavour.15.a: "I guess we should let it slide..."
 bpm_christdem_flavour.15.b: "Discipline them! Nobody will disrespect our national symbols."
 





 


 bpm_christdem_split.30.t: "The Sunset of Change"
 bpm_christdem_split.30.d: "Massive poverty, economic crisis and unimaginably dire working and living conditions led the @ig_christian_democrats! #blue Christian Democrats#! to transform their ideology towards very anti-capitalist and democratic positions, putting a universal political and socio—economical democracy at the forefront — proposing the introduction of universal suffrage, women's suffrage, economic socialization and the introduction of the primacy of central planning, all limited by Christian morality and civil society."
 bpm_christdem_split.30.f: "The political democratization of our lives must be complemented by economic and social democratization.\n\n(...)\n\nLiberal-capitalist policy has proved fatal, especially in its social effects. It harms the basis of a healthy social order, having as its main goal only the greatest possible personal profit for the entrepreneur and capitalist, with no regard for the principle of justice, human dignity and the common good.\n\n— Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy) Program, 1937" # Enterprises of great importance for the economic life of the Nation or its defense, and large joint-stock enterprises and their complexes, where the initiative and management of the owner do not play a major role gradually as the appropriate conditions mature, will pass into the ownership of the state, local governments or social associations. Medium-sized and small enterprises should be made more accessible to private ownership, and the development of Poland's handicrafts should also be given considerable support.

Socialists. This term in this cases refers to Catholic activists that seeked to fully introduce the encyclical ‘Rerum novarum’.

The supporters of a modern interventionist economy vary greatly in their committment to [GetLawType('law_interventionism').GetName]. Generally seeking to promote modern economical policies, they will support regulatory economics, modernization and state support of industrialization, but may also support more economically democratic and statist policies — like #gold democratization#! of ownership; [Concept('concept_nationalize', 'Nationalization')] of key sectors (like #yellow Heavy Industry#!, [GetBuildingType('building_railway').GetName]) or even #bold limited state planning#! to combat [Concept('concept_unemployed', 'Unemployment')] or lack of [Concept('concept_good', 'Resources')].

 ##### Decentralization and State Power

 bpm_christdem_split.4.t: "On State Power and Decentralization"
 bpm_christdem_split.4.desc: "The decentralization of the state and the desire to strengthen local structures have always been important to Catholics. Most share the view that decentralization of the state is necessary, but not to the same extent.\n\nOne group believes that a strongly federalized, cohesive state should be maintained or introduced, while the other group strives for much deeper decentralization of the state, noting its weaknesses and incompetence."
 bpm_christdem_split.4.f: "The state is, by definition, incapable of managing even a simple cobbler's shop.\n\n— Luigi Sturzo, 1951"
 bpm_christdem_split.4.a: "Deep decentralization is much needed, and we should actively seek it."
 bpm_christdem_split.4.b: "Decentralization is important, but the stability of the state is much more."
 bpm_christdem_split.4.c: "The state should be strong and maintain a calm public order."


 ##### Economy and Capitalism
 
 bpm_christdem_split.5.t: "On Economy and Capitalism"

 bpm_christdem_split.5.d: "Liberal capitalism, industrialization, and a complete revolution in every area and aspect of human life were initially met with great hostility and resistance from Catholic activists and Catholic laymen. However, over time, many of them accepted it, differing in their approach to it.\n\nSome believe that capitalism is generally positive, and that the state should pursue a fiscal conservatism, while others seek to limit it in favor of the state and citizens through gradual democratization and the equalization of differences. Some, though quiet, see capitalism as an absolute evil and seek to replace it with a strongly democratized, centrally planned economy."
 bpm_christdem_split.5.f: "The enormous gap between rich and poor must be bridged — woe betide us if it is not! The commandment of love is even higher before God than the commandment of justice.\n\n— Karl Freiherr von Vogelsang"

 bpm_christdem_split.5.a: "A peaceful cooperation between capital and workers will bring forth great fruits."
 bpm_christdem_split.5.b: "Capitalism needs futher reform and change."
 bpm_christdem_split.5.c: "Liberal-capitalist policy has proved fatal and must be destroyed."
 bpm_christdem_split.5.d: "An agrarian-based economy must be upheld and actively supported."

 ##### Lay Movements and the Church

 bpm_christdem_split.3.t: "On Lay Movements and the Church"
 bpm_christdem_split.3.d: "All @ig_christian_democrats! Catholics seek to empower Catholic morality in the state as well as actively defend their own influence from modernist secularism and political liberalism. Some Catholics want to have the Church cooperate with the lay movements against the modernist threat, while some seek to develop independently, potentially fighting with the Church for people."
 bpm_christdem_split.3.f: "It is better to obey God than people.\n\n— Wojciech Korfanty, 1927"
 bpm_christdem_split.3.a: "The Church shall oversee the process."
 bpm_christdem_split.3.b: "The Church can only become our enemy, not ally."

 ##### Religion

 bpm_christdem_split.6.t: "On Religion and Morality"
 bpm_christdem_split.6.d1: "All @ig_christian_democrats! Catholics are religious to a greater or lesser extent, but they are religious nonetheless. Therefore, the need to maintain the religious and moral aspect of humanity in general has always been and continues to be significant, and many believers strive to uphold the religious and moral character of the law and the activities of the state, but not everyone agrees on the scope and strength of this ideal.\n\nSome seek to maintain a stronger basis for law and the state in religion, others strive for a deeper moderation of religious moralism, and some seek a broader restriction of religion in political life and even the separation of church and state." 
 bpm_christdem_split.6.f: "It is better to obey God than people.\n\n— Wojciech Korfanty, 1927"

 bpm_christdem_split.6.a: "Catholicism shall regulate all aspects of public life."
 bpm_christdem_split.6.b: "Freedom of consciece must be guaranteed, and public administration must be kept professional."
 bpm_christdem_split.6.c: "Religious morality is important, but our freedom is even more."

 ##### Welfare

 bpm_christdem_split.7.t: "On Welfare and Charity"
 bpm_christdem_split.7.d1: "Many @ig_christian_democrats! Catholic laymen sincerely believe in charity and the need for humanity as a whole to provide every person with access to the all life necessities.\n\nSome believe that civil society and charity alone will provide for everyone, while others believe in the strong use of the state to provide benefits to everyone, and still others seek to find a middle ground and use both ideas to a limited extent."
 bpm_christdem_split.7.f: "A charity which knows only how to give money is not yet Christian love. You will be free of guilt only when you also give your time, your energy, and your resourcefulness to help end such abuses for good, and when you allow nothing that lies hidden in the storehouse of your Christian religion to remain unused against the cancer that is destroying the vitality of our society in such alarming ways\n\n— Abraham Kuyper, 1891"

 bpm_christdem_split.7.a: "One man helping the other through charity is the fairest way to ensure a decent life."
 bpm_christdem_split.7.b: "Charity is not enough, the state must ensure some public welfare for the workingman."
 bpm_christdem_split.7.c: "The private hand has failed to protect the workingman, the state must take total reign."
 bpm_christdem_split.7.d: "Combined religious welfare and charity will bring forth great fruits."

 ##### Nationalism

 bpm_christdem_split.8.t: "On Nationalism and Borders"
 bpm_christdem_split.8.desc: "@ig_christian_democrats! Catholic laymen have long had a strong sense of their culture, but with the advent of nationalism and modern perceptions of people, the way this culture is related to has shifted considerably. In the past, many of them felt a sense of belonging only to their family and place of residence; now, more and more of them are finding new senses of belonging and places.\n\nNationalism has caused some to fall in love with their nation and find enemies in others, while others have found a strong sense of belonging to humanity as a whole and maintain the pursuit of uniting small groups into a single whole. Meanwhile some have found a golden mean between the two radical perceptions."
 bpm_christdem_split.8.f: "While it is natural that the clergy, as a component part of a broader social order, should take the interests of the fatherland to heart, it is neither natural nor Christian to slip into any kind of nationalism or particularism, which involve losing that superiority of judgement that derives from universal Christian morality.\n\n— Luigi Sturzo, 1929"
 
 bpm_christdem_split.8.a: "All borders, whether internal or international, must be weakened and eventually abolished."
 bpm_christdem_split.8.b: "All people should be allowed to seek a new safe haven."
 bpm_christdem_split.8.c: "Our country should maintain protection for local indigenous cultures and fight those too foreign." # [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCulture.GetName]
 bpm_christdem_split.8.d: "All cultures should be protected, but we must retain the primacy of our culture."
 bpm_christdem_split.8.e: "All cultures weaken our state and identity, thus must be removed."

 ##### Democracy

 bpm_christdem_split.9.t: "On Democracy and Suffrage"
 bpm_christdem_split.9.desc: "Liberal democracy, once something to which most @ig_christian_democrats! Catholics were hostile, has today become something that is widely accepted by virtually everyone, permeating various areas of human life. Many Catholics are now more or simply positively disposed towards democracy, believing in its necessity in society, but everyone differs in their vision.\n\nSome seek to limit the explicitly ’parliamentary-liberal’ part, some seek to maintain it but without violating the principle of divine sovereignty, while some others believe in the need to introduce a synthesis of Democracy and Christianity and strive to expand it."
 bpm_christdem_split.9.f: "Today, you need gold, lots of gold, to enjoy the right to speak; we are not rich enough. Silence for the poor.\n\n— Félicité de La Mennais, 1848"

 bpm_christdem_split.9.a: "We are democrats, christian democrats."
 bpm_christdem_split.9.b: "Divine sovereignty should be retained within a democracy."
 bpm_christdem_split.9.c: "Democracy should be a suplement for a strong rule."

 ##### Military

 bpm_christdem_split.10.t: "On Military and Defence"
 bpm_christdem_split.10.desc: "The desire to maintain peace and protect one's own has always been common among followers of the Catholic Church. Added to this, nationalism and modern militarism led to a general shift among @ig_christian_democrats! Catholics towards pacifist positions and hostility towards an overly exaggerated military.\n\nThe first group maintains the need for a strong and modern military, but only for defense, while continuing to strive for peace and mutual cooperation, while the second group strives for the gradual, complete demilitarization of the entire world and universal peace."
 bpm_christdem_split.10.f: "Those who have faith move mountains; those who have faith make converts; those who have faith win battles.\n\n— Luigi Sturzo, 1922"

 bpm_christdem_split.10.a: "We need extraordinary means of national defence."
 bpm_christdem_split.10.b: "Our army should be strong and modern."
 bpm_christdem_split.10.c: "We must pursue total and universal demilitarization."

 ##### Women (WHERE?)
 
 bpm_christdem_split.11.t: "On Women and Suffrage"
 bpm_christdem_split.11.desc: "For Catholic laymen, the family is extremely important, and since its inception they have sought to defend and support it.\n\nWith the emergence of feminism, Catholics too have changed their thinking about women, and the vast majority of them want to ensure the right to vote for women, some of whom still prefer that they stay at home.\n\nHowever, there are also those who would prefer that women not participate in politics at all."
 bpm_christdem_split.11.f: ""
 
 bpm_christdem_split.11.a: "Women should be able to vote, but really their proper place is at home."
 bpm_christdem_split.11.b: "Women's proper place is only at home."

 ##### Rise of Christian Democracy

 bpm_christdem_split.12.t: "The Rise of Christian Democracy"
 bpm_christdem_split.12.desc: "With the advent of the encyclicals ‘Rerum novarum’ and ‘Graves de communi re’ a new ideology — @ig_christian_democrats! Christian Democracy — has begun to expand into the political sphere. Christian Democrats are difficult to define, as they vary enormously from country to country, but the vast majority support suffrage, corporatism and religious morality, sometimes also aiming to change the world based on Catholic Social Teaching.\n\nTheir emergence may shake history, or it may not actually change anything."
 bpm_christdem_split.12.f: "The Centre Party is basically a political and not a confessional party. It takes its stand on the German Constitution, which requires deputies to regard themselves as representatives of the people as a whole.\n\n— Centre Party Leadership, 1909"

 bpm_christdem_split.12.a: "So they finally decided whether they are Christians, or Democrats?"

 ##### Afermath

 bpm_christdem_split.13.t: "Aftermath"
 bpm_christdem_split.13.d: "The emergence of Christian Democrats in many places in Europe has led to significant changes contrary to what its perennial enemies expected. In various countries, they have joined the political machinery in full force and formed parties or took them over, weakening former elites.\n\nIn some places they have forced the introduction of major reforms like [GetLawType('law_universal_suffrage').GetName], social [GetLawGroup('lawgroup_welfare').GetName], modern economic policies; while in others they seek to strengthen the state and develop it around corporatism and the teachings of the church, curbing liberal and leftist extremes."
 bpm_christdem_split.13.f: "Let us learn, first of all, to defend our belief without hating our adversaries, to appreciate those who do not think as we do, to recognize that there are Christians in every camp, and that God can be served now as always! Let us complain less of our times and more of ourselves. Let us not be discouraged, let us be better.\n\n— Frédéric Ozanam"

This means under this label we can put heterogeneous groups and beliefs that are polar opposites of one another, like for example the Lithuanian ethnonationalist #v Krikščionys Demokratai#! and the Italian internationalist #v Popularists#!, but both have a challange they want to answer.\n\nIt also puts a distinct line between other forms of #v Polticial Catholicism#! that in varying degrees base themselves on Catholic Social Teachings; or hold belief in democracy, but seek to introduce a different replacament or form for it.

 je_bpm_group_young_right_p1: "Their birth can be put on the March 30th, 1891, with the creation of #bold ‘Ligue démocratique belge’#! (#italic Belgian Democratic League, L.D.B.#!). The #v Young Right#!, even though enjoyed risng popular and Leo XIII‘s support (July 1895), had to  overcome various, massive obstacles and fight with many groups both within and outisde of the Catholic Party, like various #gold Socialists#!, #gold Liberals#!, #gold the Catholic Church#! (who wanted to maintain unity, and also were often allied with Woeste) and sometimes even the #gold King Leopold II#! (who wrote to the Pope Leo XIII about the #v Young Right#! a few times).\n\nThe Old Right denied the #bold L.D.B.#!‘s right to exist and actively fought it by playing for time, cooperating with bishops, shutting down various congresses (like one in #italic Liège#!), refusing electoral lists, and most importantly fighting any Christian Democrat-led legislation, especially social. The 1893 mixed universal suffrage allowed the #v Young Right#! to expand into parliamentary politics and got them 12 seats in the Parliament but also caused a crisis in the L.D.B. due the reluctant vote of 8-member group called ’groupe démocratique’ for a municipal elections bill that disfavoured workers which led to Helleputte's resignation as a chairman, but they eventually managed to survive.\n\nThe Pope's intervention on the behalf of the #v Young Right#! allowed them to be admitted to Catholic lists in 1895 municipal elections. A truce was made in 1896 between the two factions as legislative elections approached, but Woeste had the Catholics close the lists and set up a commission within the F.C.C.C.A. to draw up a social program with the goal of weakening and assimilating the Christian Democrats. Locally though, the conservatives allowed the christian democrats to be put on electoral lists, ultimately allowing the #v Young Right#! to get 14 seats in Federal Parliament.\n\n#tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_bpm_group_young_right_tooltip_p2 #bold #grey Second Page#!#!#!\n#tooltippable;tooltip:[Country.GetTooltipTag],je_bpm_christ_dem_pedia_tooltip #bold #gold ChristDemPedia#!#!#!" #

Sint-Truiden congress (May 1897) where he proposed a joint committee in each electoral district to bring various social movements and groups together. Woeste agreed to meet the Democrats in October 1897 but ultimately he maintained his opposing position, and despite intervention of bishops, the ‘Saint-Trond formula’ was not accepted by the #v Old Right#!. However in various places in #gold Belgium#! there were set up joint committees and agreements made for preparations for the 1898 elections. The Young Right retained their representatives and gained wider support.\n\nAs time went on Woeste‘s influence kept slowly going down, while the Young Right‘s support kept on growing, with bishops and newspapers siding with them.\n\nThe war between the Young and the Old Right had shifted from the hushed grassroots to the floor of Parliament. The legislative elections of May 27, 1906, had somewhat reduced the government's majority, without however jeopardizing it. The Young Right‘s discontent with government's conservatism was expressed with abstain during the vote for Sunday rest law (July 26th, 1905).\n\nThe bill for mining consessions in Campine gave a grand opportunity to show their strength. The Christian Democrats gave conditions for granting these consessions: pensions for miners, a limit of eight hours on working hours, a ban on underground work for women and children, and improved sanitary facilities for workers. The Old Right and Woeste, knowing the upcoming danger, responded by proposing refer the matter back to committee. His motion was rejected. The christian democrats intented to grant maximum benefits for miners despite the Old Right urging them not to impose ‘reforms that the country does not demand’.\n\nWith nobody wanting to give in to the other's demands, the crisis became public, with the Socialists and Radical Liberals supporting the Young Right and cooperating with each other. The christian democrats questioned the composition of the government as not representative of the whole right, then the more moderate previous P.M. Beernaert joined the opposition. On April 12th, 1907 Old Right government was defeated and so was the bill, with 59 Catholics and 11 liberals for, and 34 socialists, 23 radicals and 19 christian democrats against.

When eventually Charles de Broqueville, a moderate and somebody who was more close to Christian Democracy, took lead in the Catholic Party, the ‘Old‘ Old Right stopped funtionally existing and the Catholic Party became more Christian Democratic-aligned.\n\nSources used:\n- Jeune droite et vieille droite avant le congrès catholique de 1909, by Philippe Defossez;\n- Christian Democracy in Western Europe, by Michael P.
